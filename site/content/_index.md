    Natasha Yankelevich is the photographer and designer from Moscow.\

    She was born in November 1, 1988. In 2005 she entered the Russian Tourism
    and Service University deciding to learn graphic design. After ending the
    university she worked as the graphic and web designer. Also she started to
    take part in creative shootings as a model. She was inspired by the process
    and the photo industry, so decided to make captures by herself.\

    \

    Since that time Natasha took part in numerous projects - сreative and
    fashion shootings, magazine's publications, exhibitions. Natasha’s first
    exhibition took place in Moscow gallery “Zdes na Taganke”\

    \

    The main thing in her photography is to get a real emotion, that can be
    understandable for everyone. All of her subjects are about sensuality in
    each of us. It is the little stories about thoughts, senses and invisible
    miracles, on way to yourself.
