# About me
My name is Matt Korinek, I am a commercial fitness, lifestyle and editorial photographer currently based in Vancouver, Canada.

I've made it my mission to tell compelling stories by organically capturing imagery that evokes emotion in the viewer. My approach is a synergy of commercial and editorial styles, creating scenarios and providing direction while also letting the best moments unfold naturally. 

When I'm not doing photographer related things, I can often be found outdoors with a cold beer in hand, enjoying the company of friends.

Thanks for stopping by!
